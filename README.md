<p align="center"><i>The Shield of Two Realities — Beyond Encryption, Security Against Coercion</i></p>

---

## ❓ What happens when encryption isn't enough?

We trust our most private conversations to “secure” apps. End-to-end encryption is hailed as the ultimate shield.  
But there’s a fatal flaw.

An attacker doesn’t need to break encryption — they just need to break *you*.  
If someone can coerce you into unlocking your phone, your fortress collapses.

That’s not a *security flaw* — it’s a *reality flaw*.  
And **AegisParadox** fixes it.

## ✨ Introducing: Decoy Mode with Plausible Deniability

**AegisParadox** is a proof-of-concept messenger that protects you *even under coercion*.

🔑 **Two Passwords. Two Cryptographically Separate Realities.**

- **Your Real Password** → Unlocks your sensitive conversations.  
- **Your Decoy Password** → Opens a fake, harmless chat history.  

No attacker can prove the decoy is fake. That’s **plausible deniability**.
